# Algiers Ground

## General Provisions

The SMC controller’s callsign, for radio communication and coordination, is “Algiers Ground”.

The SMC controller is the first station for all departing aircraft (IFR/VFR) to call and is responsible for operations on the surface of Algiers International Airport, such as pushback/engine start-up, repositioning and taxi.

| Terminal 2  | Domestic          | C1-C9          |
| Terminal 4  | International     | T1-T11, W13-W25|

Stands at Terminal West (T4) are typically used by international Air Algérie flights and other major carriers, such as Vueling, Air France and British Airways, whilst Terminal 1 serves both international and domestic flights operated by Air Algérie.

Remote stands located in South Parking (P13 and P14) are used by Air Algérie B737 domestic flights as well as Tassili Airlines.

Stand availability and compatibility with the aircraft type shall be checked if a pilot requests an alternative stand. If an issue with the requested stand is found, the pilot shall be informed and recommend a different stand nearby. If no issues are found, the requested stand shall be assigned.

## Start-up and Release

The pushback direction depends on the location of the aircraft and runway configuration.

If the pilot does not report the current ATIS letter on first contact, SMC shall pass the current ATIS letter.  A start-up instruction shall, in addition, include an assigned discrete SSR code.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, Algiers Ground, push and start approved, face east, squawk 2613”.

IFR aircraft require a subject release before receiving a release for departure. SMC must inform TWR of a departing aircraft at or before Target Start-up Approval Time (TSAT), and after an SSR code has been assigned.

If a start-up clearance cannot be obtained right away or if the pilot is not prepared to start the aircraft within the next five minutes during high traffic conditions, the pilot needs to be made aware of the updated TSAT.

## VFR Aircraft

VFR circuits shall not be permitted at the aerodrome during times of increased IFR departure or arrival activity and shall be permitted only after prior coordination with TWR.

## Taxiway Usage and Restrictions

Although there are no regulated taxi routes in Algiers, it is advised that outbound traffic use apron inner-taxiways and incoming traffic use apron outer-taxiways. All taxiways are labelled code F and can accommodate all types of aircraft.

## Runway Change Procedure

TWR shall provide ample notice to SMC before changing runway configuration. The last departure using the old configuration shall be coordinated between TWR, SMC and APP.

Aircraft that have already been cleared to taxi using the old configuration shall be re-cleared if they have not already reached the holding point.

# Algiers Tower

## General Provisions

The aerodrome controller’s (ADC) callsign, for radio communication and coordination, is “Algiers Tower”.

Tower (TWR) is responsible for all aerodrome movements on runways and their associated taxiways and all operations within the Algiers CTR below 1 500 ft. 

TWR shall also ensure separation between IFR aircraft that are arriving at and departing the aerodrome, as well as provide traffic information about VFR flights operating within the aerodrome control zone.

## Runway Selection

Algiers Tower determines the direction of operations. Unless demand requires it, runway configurations should not be mixed and runways 05 and 27 shall be used for departures and runways 09 and 23 for arrivals.

## Departure and Release Procedures

Algiers Tower is responsible for issuing airway clearances prior to flight. The controller validates the flight plan including departure procedure, flight level and flight rules. 

When coordinating departures with APP, TWR shall advise APP of the Target Take-Off Time (TTOT). A departure release request, shall be approved by APP by stating "subject release".

Prior to departing, TWR will request an enroute clearance from TMA by informing APP of the flight callsign and destination airport and the following will then be given:

* ATC route clearance;
* Process of requested flight level instruction;
* Any other information that may affect traffic management

In the case that the TMA is only capable of accommodating a departure for a limited amount of time, APP may impose a release validity time. If the traffic is unable to comply with the time, TWR must request a new release time from APP.

On transfer, traffic is released for climbing in accordance with the coordinated clearance.

## Departure Clearances

An IFR clearance shall be in the following format:

* Callsign;
* Departure procedure;
* Final level within Alger FIR

Example: "Air Algerie 1040, after departure runway 27, turn left, flight level 100 until BNA, CSO next, flight level 270".

For IFR departures, an agreement is in place to clear aircraft via standard tracks, however, to assist TMA in the handling of these departures against arrival traffic, or due to a lack of airway capacity, TMA or ACC may amend a routing or flight level. 

Departures are permitted to climb visually to their requested final level unless informed otherwise by APP or if APP is offline and no higher station is online, TWR is to issue the following standard after departures instruction and clear a departure to their final level:

| RWY         | Direction of Flight | Departure Procedure |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| -           | North or West       | Intercept outbound radial [DEGREES] ALR on track to [FIX], flight level [ALT] |
| 05          | South or East       | Right turn DCT BNA, [FIX] next, flight level [ALT] |
| 23          | South or East       | Left turn DCT BNA, [FIX] next, flight level [ALT] |

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, after departure runway 05, turn left via radial 020 ALR, flight level 350".

A conditional clearance is a clearance issued by an air traffic controller which does not become effective until a specified condition has been satisfied. Conditional line up instructions must include the traffic that the aircraft is to follow, as well as the word “behind” at the beginning and end of the transmission.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, behind the departing company Boeing 737-800, lineup and wait, runway 05, behind".

However, if the aircraft ahead is already well clear, the next aircraft may be instructed simply to: “line up and wait.”

## Separation Requirements

Aircraft shall be separated on departure in compliance with standard IFR departure wake turbulence separation requirements. Departures with the same flow point must be separated by at least 7 NM or the appropriate wake turbulence requirement, whichever is greater. A greater separation needs to be coordinated between the radar controller and TWR. 

All fixed-wing IFR departures with the same TMA flow point shall be transferred to APP with 7 NM in trail.  For separation of 7 NM, the proceeding traffic needs to be 4-5 NM away from the end of the departure runway. If no radar screen is used, two minute separation can be used in this case as well.

If the distance ends up being less than 7 NM but more than 3NM (ensured), coordination is required and avoiding action to be taken by the pilot is given when the controller considers that an imminent risk
a collision will exist if action is not taken immediately.

VFR aircraft may be instructed to maintain visual separation with preceding aircraft and given a take-off clearance if no wake turbulence or flow separation minima exist.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, wind 070 degrees, 12 knots, runway 05, cleared for take-off".

When traffic is clear of DER (if there is no WTS minima) or the respective minima between the two aircraft, a departure may be cleared for aircraft that do not require separation along the same flow point or a WTS minima greater than 7 NM. However, the controller shall provide traffic information as appropriate to ensure traffic is separated upon TMA entry.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, wind 070 degrees, 12 knots, runway 05, cleared for take-off, proceeding traffic ATR-600".

ADC shall use caution when departing aircraft with different speed profiles and is fully responsible for ensuring that horizontal or vertical separation exists at all times. It is thus advised that a VFR aircraft on a visual climbout must turn more than 45° from the runway track in order to allow succeeding IFR traffic to depart with separation of less than 3 NM in trail.

## Cancelling or Stopping a Take-off

IFR departures shall be instructed to contact the radar controller once airborne in the take-off clearance.
When an aircraft has commenced the take-off roll, and it is necessary for the aircraft to abandon take-off in order to avert a dangerous traffic situation, the aircraft should be instructed to stop immediately and the instruction and callsign repeated.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, stop immediately, Air Algérie 1040, stop immediately".

For aircraft that have been given a take-off clearance, but have not yet started the roll, they shall be instructed to hold position and the take-off clearance must be cancelled along with the reason for cancellation.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, hold position, cancel take-off I say again cancel take-off, traffic on the runway".

## Arrival Procedures

The TMA controller is responsible for establishing longitudinal separation between arrivals until touchdown. If they fall below the separation minima, ADC has to instruct the pilot to go around. In this case, coordination with APP is strongly recommended.

The minimum separation between two aircraft approaching the same runway is always 7 NM or wake turbulence separation, whichever is higher.

If it is apparent that minimum separation is infringed, ADC may apply a speed reduction to maintain in order to ensure separation, however, controllers must use caution as proceeding arrival flows may be inconvenienced. As such, continuous coordination between APP and ADC is highly recommended.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, reduce to minimum approach speed".

Aircraft may be instructed to maintain their separation visually if speed control alone will not resolve the conflict. This shall only be done in VMC and with an agreement with the pilot. If no other solutions are practical, the succeeding aircraft shall be instructed to go around.

## Missed Approach Instructions

Instructions to carry out a missed approach may be given to avert an unsafe situation. When a missed approach is initiated, cockpit workload is inevitably high. Any transmissions to aircraft going around should be brief and kept to a minimum.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, go around".

Once the traffic has acknowledged the instruction and is observed to be safely climbing away, they shall be handed off to the TMA controller.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, via standard missed approach, climb 3 000 ft, contact Algiers Approach 121.4".

In the case that there is a risk that the go-around aircraft will overtake the departing aircraft, instructions for avoiding action shall be given to the departing aircraft in the form of altitude restrictions. Additionally, if separation is infringed, each aircraft shall receive relevant traffic information, respectively. 

In case of a go around, the published missed approach is the following:

| Runway | Route              | Climb     |
|--------|--------------------|------------|
| 05 and 09 (West) | Intercept R344 ALR | 3 000 ft |
| 23 and 27 (East) | Intercept R344 ALR | 2 500 ft |

Departures shall not be permitted to commence their take-off roll until separation with go-around traffic is assured.

## Taxi Operations

To minimise delays in changing frequency, Algiers Tower is responsible for issuing initial taxi instructions and stand/parking area assignment before aircraft are handed off to SMC, although if no further instructions are required, ADC may keep arriving traffic on its frequency.

If a potential conflict arises, it is likely to generate more waiting time, therefore, it is recommended that aircraft are not assigned a new gate and are handed off to SMC in advance.

## VFR Aircraft

Entry, exit and transit VFR as well as special VFR routes are mandatory in the control zone (CTR).

In the vicinity of VFR points W, S and E, traffic shall report their entry/exit at 1 000 ft or below.

## Departures

VFR traffic shall be cleared using the most appropriate VFR route on track to the destination, in accordance with the published VFR routes.

Example: “7T-VRT, after departure runway 09, turn left on track F, 1 000 ft, VFR”.

Only after prior coordination with the APP shall traffic that requests clearance to climb into the TMA be released. If not, they will be instructed to remain outside of controlled airspace after exiting the control zone and to squawk the VFR standard code”.

Example: “7T-VRT, leave CTR via F, remain outside controlled airspace, squawk 7000”.

## Aerodrome Traffic Circuits

VFR aircraft wishing to do circuits at Algiers shall receive clearance in the following format:

Example: “7T-VRT, runway 09, standard circuit, 1 000 ft, VFR”.

VFR traffic wishing to remain in the circuit shall be cleared only after prior coordination with ADC and shall either be assigned right-hand patterns for runway 09 or standard circuits (left-hand) for runway 23.

Circuit direction should be assigned to prevent aircraft from overflying the airport and shall be conducted at an altitude of 1 000 ft. Aircraft may also be cleared to conduct circuits at 1 500 ft if required for high-performance aircraft.

## Arrivals

Aircraft may request either touch and go, a stop and go, a low approach, or a full stop.

Once the Tower Controller is aware of the aircraft’s intentions within the control zone, they may be sequenced to the runway, with due consideration given to runway occupancy time.

Aircraft on the downwind should be passed the following information:

* Expected runway;
* Sequence;
* Traffic information if applicable

Inbound VFR aircraft shall be sent to ADC with enough time such that two-way radio communications have been established before aircraft enter the control zone.

On initial contact, ADC will pass the instructions for joining the circuit, as well as any other pertinent information such as traffic information with the sector.

Example: “7T-VRT, runway 27, enter CTR via E, VFR”.

During times of heavy IFR arrival activity, VFR arrivals may be denied entry into the control zone and instructed to hold outside of the CTR awaiting further instructions. Once a slot has been coordinated between ADC and APP, VFR arrivals may proceed, however, the estimated delay must be given to the pilot if the clearance limit surpasses 5 minutes.

Example: “7T-VRT, hold over S, expect onward clearance time 55”.

## VFR Helicopters

Visual routes of helicopters in the control zone (CTR) require authorisation from APP.

Prior to entry or exit of the CTR, traffic shall report in the vicinity of routes HA and HB at 1 000 ft or below.

## Low Visibility Procedures (LVP)

The three stages of Low Visibility Procedures are:

| Factor           | Preparation Stage                | In-force Stage                 | Termination Stage                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| RVR              | 1 000 m or less                  | Less than 550 m               | More than 550 m and increasing     |
| Reported Visibility | 1 200 m or less                  | 800 m or less                  | More than 800 m and increasing     |
| Cloud Base       | Less than 400 ft                 | Less than 200 ft              | More than 200 ft and increasing    |

Landing clearance must be issued no less than 2 NM from touchdown. The tower shall advise all arrivals to report 2 DME; if landing clearance cannot be issued before 2 DME, the aircraft must execute a missed approach.

Example: "Air Algérie 1040, wind 070 degrees, 12 knots, runway 27, cleared to land, runway visual range 650 metres, 700 metres and 600 metres”.

Arriving aircraft should be given the easiest taxi route to allow them to clear the localiser-sensitive area expeditiously.

Landing clearance shall not be issued until:

* Preceding landing aircraft has vacated the localiser-sensitive area.
* Preceding departing aircraft is airborne and has passed over the localiser antenna (DER).

The Localiser Sensitive Area in front of an arriving aircraft shall not be infringed from the time it is 2 NM from the touchdown unit it has completed its landing roll.

During Take-off in CAT II/III condition, the Localizer Sensitive Area in front of a departure aircraft shall not be infringed from the time take-off clearance is issued until the aircraft has departed and passed over DER/the stop end of the runway.

# Algiers Approach

## General

Algiers Approach (APP) is in charge of all traffic within the Alger TMA and is required to offer approach control services to aircraft from the time and location at which arriving aircraft are released by Alger ACC until control is transferred to ADC, departing aircraft on specific routes are transferred from ADC until they are transferred to the relevant Alger ACC or until an aircraft is clear of controlled airspace.

APP provides services suitable for approach control tasks and ensures uniform separation between Special VFR and IFR flights as well as between Special VFR flights.

## Separation Minima

7 NM radar separation minima between all aircraft is to be applied by APP.

## Departures

Departing aircraft shall be cleared to their final level before handoff to ACC unless they were cleared to a lower altitude in their departure clearance and are to be handed off 2 minutes prior to reaching the vertical or lateral limits of the TMA.

When issuing deviations off track be required, APP shall ensure departures are above MRVA or are able to maintain visual separation from the terrain.

Speed restrictions below FL100 may be cancelled by APP in order to increase separation.

If no deviations are required, APP shall advise traffic to "proceed as cleared".

## Release Procedures

It is the responsibility of APP to provide releases that ensure separation between departing and arriving traffic. This may be achieved by passing a “released time XX” or “released subject [PRECEDING DEPARTURE] plus X minutes” restriction. 

If the given departure procedure will ensure radar separation from such other traffic, departing aircraft may be assigned the same or higher level than an inbound aircraft that conflicts with them or a previous departure on the same route (this form of separation must not be applied with traffic on own navigation).

## Arrivals

On initial contact, arrivals shall be instructed to “expect vectoring“ for the assigned runway and approach type on first contact with Algiers Approach. The assigned runway should be the one stated in the ATIS, otherwise, approval by Algiers Tower is required. 

Aircraft arriving via the north/west shall be transferred approaching F150 or F140 from the south/east if the requested cruise level is greater than F145 or F135, respectively. 

Successive inbounds will be transferred with 10 NM in trail, constant or increasing. Aircraft are 
released for turns and descent on transfer unless otherwise coordinated by Algiers ACC.

## Terminating Points

Arriving aircraft, by default, shall be issued the ILS approach for their assigned runway and radar vectoring to the localiser should commence before or upon reaching of the following recommended fixes.

| RWY | Direction From | FIX   |
|-----|----------------|-------|
| 09  | North or South | SMR   |
| 23  | North or South | ZEM or LIMON |
|  -  | Wast           | MAR or SMR   |
|  -  | Eest           | ZEM |

## Boufarik Aerodrome

Top-down service will only be provided to DAAG. If DAAKAPP or TWR is offline, top-down service will not be provided to aircraft operating at DAAK. 

Departing aircraft that request to enter controlled airspace shall receive ATC clearance on initial contact and primary radar identification. Arriving aircraft shall be cleared to leave controlled airspace via their requested approach procedure and requested to advise once on the ground to close their flight plan.
