## Departures

### En Route Clearance and Start-up

<p>To prevent any unnecessary delays, pilots are provided with their start-up clearance along with their en route clearance. This clearance includes a SID, and pilots can expect an initial climb to FL080.</p>

<p>Please note that a separate clearance for pushback is still required, even if you have already received your start-up clearance. If you are not able to begin pushback or start-up within 5 minutes of receiving your clearance, please plan accordingly and only request your en route clearance when you are prepared to proceed.</p>

<p>Please see the ATIS for the current runway in use. The runway will be confirmed either prior to taxi or during the pushback clearance by Ground.</p>

<p>In situations of high traffic volume, when you request start-up, you may receive a Target Start-up Approval Time (TSAT). This TSAT indicates the anticipated time for you to receive approval for start-up/pushback.</p>

<p>If you request start-up while also requesting your en route clearance, your TSAT will be provided simultaneously. However, if you have not requested a start-up clearance, it is your responsibility to inform ATC when you are prepared.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="text">
  <p><span style="color:rgb(170,0,0);">GMMX_DEL:</span>&emsp;"Royal Air Maroc 402 delta, start up time at 1732 (TSAT 17:32z), report aircraft ready"</p>
  <p><span style="color:rgb(170,0,0);">RAM402D:</span>&emsp;"Wilco, Royal Air Maroc 402 delta"</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>To ensure a smooth operation, we recommend that you plan to be ready at least 5 minutes prior to your assigned TSAT (you are expected to recall Delivery 5 minutes before TSAT). Additionally, when filing your flight plan, you will be assigned a CTOT (Calculated Take Off Time).</p>

<p>Your CTOT is the estimated time for when you will be cleared for take-off. Please note that your actual departure time may be 5 minutes earlier or 10 minutes later than your CTOT.</p>

### Taxi

<p>Ground movement at GMMX is extremely straightforward. After starting your engines and completing all necessary checklists, expect to receive clearance to taxi to your assigned runway. You will then be instructed to hold short of the runway at the designated holding point.</p>

<p>Before crossing the runway, it is important to establish contact with the Tower controller. Even if Runway 17L/35R is not in use, you must receive clearance before crossing.</p>

### Take-off

<p>Once you are next in sequence for departure, the Tower controller will instruct you to line-up and wait. Please complete all necessary pre-departure checklists before receiving clearance to line-up for departure.</p>

<p>As part of the take-off clearance, Tower will include instructions for you to contact Approach on the designated frequency once airborne.</p>

<p>Make sure to follow the initial climb that was provided in your start-up clearance. If you are unsure, please confirm with Tower before takeoff.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The transition altitude for GMMX is 6000 feet.</li>
  <li>After take-off, pay close attention to the initial routing of your SID and comply with altitude and speed restrictions as per charts.</li>
</ul>

## Arrivals

<p>When flying the arrival, make sure to follow the published altitude restrictions and comply with any ATC instructions. Before arriving at the Initial Approach Fix (IAF), expect the controller to either clear you for the approach, instruct you to hold or vector you. The default approach type for GMMX is the ILS if it is available, though if runway 28 is in operation, you can expect RNAV mainly. But ATC may assign a different approach type based on traffic and operational conditions.</p>
